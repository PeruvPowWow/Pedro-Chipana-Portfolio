# Pedro-Chipana-Portfolio

## Overview

This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase projects, share contact information, and present a professional online presence. The site has been designed and built using modern web technologies to ensure a responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly experience. It includes several sections like About Me, Portfolio, and Contact.

## Description

The portfolio website includes the following main sections:

- Header: Displays your name and navigation links to different sections (About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume).
- About Me Section: Includes a brief introduction and your photo.
- Portfolio Section: Showcases your key projects with links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
- Contact Form: Users can reach out to you by submitting a contact form with their details.
- Footer: Contains GitHub and LinkedIn icons, with links to your profiles.

## Changes Made

- Header Positioning: Adjusted the header layout with your name on the left and navigation links on the right. Removed the navigation bullet points and ensured proper alignment.
- About Me Section Padding: Increased padding to move the content away from the edges for a cleaner look.
- Portfolio Layout: Modified the project display layout to show two projects per row and ensured uniform image sizes across all project cards.
- Project Image Styling: Fixed an issue where project images were being zoomed or cropped incorrectly.
- Contact Form Styling: Enhanced the contact form by centering it, increasing its size, and improving input fields' styles for better user experience.
- Footer Positioning: Moved GitHub and LinkedIn links to the bottom of the page and extended the footer background to span the entire width.

## Mock-up Comparison

Before the changes:

- Header elements were not aligned properly.
- The About Me section content was hugging the sides of the page.
- Portfolio project images had inconsistent sizing.
- Contact form looked basic and unprofessional.

After the changes:

- Header, About Me, and footer sections are properly spaced and visually balanced.
- Projects in the Portfolio section are presented in a neat 2x2 grid with uniform image sizes.
- Contact form is centered, has a cleaner design, and is easier to interact with.
